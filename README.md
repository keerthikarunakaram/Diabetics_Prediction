# Diabetics_Prediction

Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas is no longer able to make insulin, or when the body cannot make good use of the insulin it produces.

The dataset is part of a dataset from the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases in the USA. Data used for diabetes research on Pima Indian women aged 21 and over living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city of the State of Arizona in the USA.
It consists of 768 observations and 8 numerical independent variables. The target variable is specified as "outcome"; 1 diabetes test result being positive, 0 indicates negative.

Features: 
1. Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies
2. Glucose: Product code (2 hour plasma glucose concentration in oral glucose tolerance test)
3. BloodPressure: Blood Pressure (mm Hg)(mm Hg)
4. SkinThickness: Skin Thickness
5. Insulin: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6. DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Function which gives 2 hour plasma glucose concentration in oral glucose tolerance test
7. Age â€“ Age (years)
8. Outcome: Have the disease (1) or not (0)

Goal: 

The purpose of this project is to predict diabetes based on diagnostic measurement metrics for early diagnosis of diabetic people.
